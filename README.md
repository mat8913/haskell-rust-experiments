My experiments in calling Haskell functions from Rust. Heavily inspired by and
uses ideas from [curryrs][curryrs].

This repo is very unstable and has only been tested on my laptop. Feel free to
use any of the ideas or code presented here but if you would like something more
stable, try [curryrs][curryrs].
